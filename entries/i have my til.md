The journey of a software engineering career has been incredibly rewarding. I've grown rapidly
in my first year, learning new things from everywhere — online resources, ChatGPT, my boss's
feedback — every day has been full of discoveries.

I felt the need to document these little learnings, and thanks to [Lee Byron](https://github.com/leebyron/til) and [Kevin Jiang](https://github.com/kevin51jiang/til)'s template, I now have my own space to do just that.

I hope to post at least a few sentences every now and then. Cheers!

## Memo for myself

To run this site locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the site
npm run build

# Preview the site locally
npm run preview
```

If the preview command doesn't work, you can also run:
```bash
npx serve dist
```
